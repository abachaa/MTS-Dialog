Patient: I'm feeling better. The burning sensation is gone. Pain has subsided. 
Doctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there? 
Patient: No discomfort, I'm just here for my follow up. Doctor X Y Z did operate on me to remove all those stones, the kidney stones. She is a good doctor. She did take care of me. I feel all new now. 
Doctor: That's nice to hear. I'm glad you are feeling okay. You remember I wrote down all the medications with their doses on your progress note, a sheet that we gave to you. Your nephew called me and he said that the prescription was lost and instructions were lost. What happened there? 
Patient: I don't know. I remember you gave me a paper saying it has all the medicines. It's everything related to them and all the things that I have to do. But I don't know what happened between the hospital and the home. I completely lost it. And I don't know where did it go. 
Doctor: It had instructions to follow up here and also to follow up with Doctor F. Do you have an appointment with Doctor F? You never did call me after the day you were dismissed from the hospital saying that you might have lost the paper that we gave to you. 
Patient: No, unfortunately I don't have any appointment with Doctor F. I was not even aware about that, that I have to take an appointment because maybe it was only there in the paper. It completely got out of my mind.

Doctor: I think it was Levaquin. Do you have any more to take? 
Patient: I do have one more to take. 
Doctor: So, when are you seeing Doctor X Y Z? 
Patient: Do I have to see her? I haven't set up anything. 
Doctor: You do. Any other issues? 
Patient: Yeah, I'm not still feeling very well. I still feel that I'm sick or something like that. It's just that I didn't get my whole self back. You said I got a stent. I have no idea. I don't feel like having one. 
Doctor: Are you the husband? 
Guest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today. 
Doctor: That's good. Okay, let me explain it to both of you once again. See, she got a ureteral stent. It means that the doctors there, they have made a pathway for the urine to flow around the kidney stone without blocking anything. So, it is to help her overall. She needs to take her medicines and make her appointment with Doctor F. Also, she does need to see if Doctor X Y Z needs a follow up. You can call them and ask. Other than that, everything seems fine. 
Patient: Yep. I will make those appointments. Thank you for your guidance. 
Doctor: Take care.","The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.

Doctor: I see. So how are you feeling now?

Doctor: It says that they put a stent in your ureter. Are you feeling any discomfort with it? Who was your doctor there?

Guest_family: Yes, I am. I just wanted to be here with her today.
