Patient: No, sadly. He passed away at thirty two years of age. Another one of my uncles on my dad's side had colon cancer in his forties. It seems to run deep in our family. 
Doctor: Oh my. Is there anyone else in your family who has battled cancer? 
Patient: I'd say about thirty some people on my dad's side had cancer. A lot of them had colon cancer and two girls had breast cancer. Oh and I remember learning from one of our cousins that we have some weird genetic syndrome that runs in the family, but I couldn't give you the name. I don't think any of us have been able to figure out the name. Sucks that we have so many problems. 
Doctor: It's definitely difficult to process, however, it's good that you and your family are aware so that you're able to seek preventative measures and get tested early for these particular cancers. If you recall the name of the genetic syndrome, please feel free to call me back so that I can update your records.  
Patient: Sure thing."
107,GENHX,"She is a very pleasant 59-year-old nurse with a history of breast cancer.  She was initially diagnosed in June 1994.  Her previous treatments included Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin.  She was found to have disease progression first noted by rising tumor markers.  PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502.  She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin.  She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle.  The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8.  She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy.  Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum.  She was seen by ENT urgently.  She was found to have nasal septum intact.  She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.","Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am, I just need some information before we get started today. 
Patient: Absolutely, good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: My chart says here that you're fifty nine years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: I also see that you have a history of breast cancer, is that correct as well?
Patient: Yes, that's also correct. 
Doctor: When were you diagnosed initially? 
Patient: Um, I was diagnosed in June of nineteen ninety four. 
Doctor: How has this been managed in the past, ma'am? 
Patient: Um, I've taken Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin. 
Doctor: How has the cancer progressed since you were diagnosed? 
Patient: The doctors said I had rising tumor markers. 
Doctor: What imaging have you done to evaluate the cancer? 
Patient: I've had a P E T C T Scan done. 
Doctor: What did that scan show?
Patient: It showed that the cancer was metastatic. 
Doctor: I see here that you were involved in a clinical trial for your breast cancer, can you tell me more about that, please? 
Patient: I was in the C T S U C four zero five zero two trial, and I was randomized into the ixabepilone plus Avastin group. 
Doctor: How did you respond to this treatment? 
Patient: Um, I had something called dose limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle. I skipped the Ixempra on the first and eighth days. 
Doctor: How did they respond once this happened? 
Patient: They just reduced the dose I was given. 
Doctor: How did you handle this reduced dose? 
Patient: Honestly, I've been tolerating the treatment pretty well. I only have some neuropathy. 
Doctor: Do you have any other concerns of note? 
Patient: Um, I thought that I had a perforated septum earlier this month, and I went to my E N T right away, but everything was okay. There was no perforation.

112,GENHX,"The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.","Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?
 Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. 
Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?
Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. 
Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is?
Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  
Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. 
Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. 
Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?
Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. 
Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?
Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. 
Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?
Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. 
Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.
Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke."

129,GENHX,"The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.

She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly ""no- no"" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.

Doctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?
Patient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.
Doctor: Do you have any voice tremors?
