<h2>Datasets, Code & Annotations</h2>

<h3>Main Dataset</h3>
The MTS-Dialog dataset is a new collection of 1.7k short doctor-patient conversations and corresponding summaries (section headers and contents). 
   
   - The training set consists of 1,201 pairs of conversations and associated summaries. 
   
   - The validation set consists of 100 pairs of conversations and their summaries. 
   
   - MTS-Dialog includes 2 test sets; each test set consists of 200 conversations and associated section headers and contents:
        - MTS-Dialog-TestSet-1-MEDIQA-Chat-2023.csv: Official test set used in the [MEDIQA-Chat 2023 challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2023/clinicalnlp-mediqa-chat-2023) (Task A)
   
        - MTS-Dialog-TestSet-2-MEDIQA-Sum-2023.csv: Official test set used in the [MEDIQA-Sum 2023 challenge](https://www.imageclef.org/2023/medical/mediqa) (Task A & Task B)

<h3>Augmented dataset</h3>
The augmented dataset consists of 3.6k pairs of medical conversations and associated summaries created from the original 1.2k training pairs via back-translation using two languages French and Spanish, as described in the paper (cf. Section 4.2).  

We provide the [full augmented training set](https://github.com/abachaa/MTS-Dialog/blob/main/Augmented-Data/MTS-Dialog-Augmented-TrainingSet-3-FR-and-ES-3603-Pairs-final.csv) that we used in the experiments, as well as the separate datasets created using the [French](https://github.com/abachaa/MTS-Dialog/blob/main/Augmented-Data/MTS-Dialog-Augmented-TrainingSet-1-En-FR-EN-2402-Pairs.csv) and [Spanish](https://github.com/abachaa/MTS-Dialog/blob/main/Augmented-Data/MTS-Dialog-Augmented-TrainingSet-2-EN-ES-EN-2402-Pairs.csv) translation models. 

<h2>Source Code</h2>
The source code for the summarization of doctor-patient conversations and the automatic generation of clinical notes. 

<h2>Manual Scores for Correlation Study</h2>

- Manual fact-based scores for the evaluation of 400 automatic summaries generated using four summarization models from the validation set of 100 conversations and notes. 

- The Factual P/R/F1 Scores, Hallucination and Omission Rates, and Levenshtein Edit Distance are computed based on the fact-based manual counts and correction. 

- We used the manual scores to evaluate the performance of several evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore, and BLEURT) by computing the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the automatic and manual scores, as described in the paper (cf. Section 5.2 and Section 5.3). 

- We provide all the [data](https://github.com/abachaa/MTS-Dialog/tree/main/Correlation-Study) needed to perform this correlation study on other evaluation metrics.
